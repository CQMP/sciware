# Sciware
Activities facilitating scientific software development skills at the Flatiron Institute



# Vision v0.1
1) A positive and inclusive learning environment for all experience levels.


2) A blend of lecture, activities, and discussion to facilitate equal involvement across experience levels.


3) Topics general enough to be relevant to anyone doing scientific research.
   - For example, technology and coding language agnostic


4) Increase awareness and adoption of software development best practices to improve scientific productivity quality.


5) To use the Flatiron Institute as a sandbox for development of something useful for all of science.


# Goal for today 
is to come up with shared vision v0.2



## Get to know each other
- Name, affiliation, and what you work on.
- What you hope to contribute/teach Sciware.
- What you hope to get/learn from Sciware.



## Rules of Engagement
- Work in small team of 2-3 people
- Take notes in a Google Doc
- At least one scribe
- One reporter


How can we foster an environment which encourages participation across experience levels, coding language fluency, technology choices, and scientific disciplines?

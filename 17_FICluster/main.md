https://github.com/flatironinstitute/learn-sciware-dev/tree/main/17_FICluster


## Rules of Engagement

### Goal:

Activities where participants all actively work to foster an environment which encourages participation across experience levels, coding language fluency, *technology choices*\*, and scientific disciplines.

<small>\*though sometimes we try to expand your options</small>


## Rules of Engagement

- Avoid discussions between a few people on a narrow topic
- Provide time for people who haven't spoken to speak/ask questions
- Provide time for experts to share wisdom and discuss
- Work together to make discussions accessible to novices

<small>
(These will always be a work in progress and will be updated, clarified, or expanded as needed.)

## Zoom Specific

- If comfortable, please keep video on so we can all see each other's faces.
- Ok to break in for quick, clarifying questions.

- We are recording. Link will be posted on #sciware Slack.

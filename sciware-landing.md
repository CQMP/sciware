# Sciware

_d_

## Vision

1. Increase awareness and adoption of software development best practices to improve scientific productivity and quality.
2. A positive and inclusive learning environment for all experience levels.
3. A blend of lecture, activities, and discussion to facilitate equal involvement across experience levels.

## Goal
Activities where participants all actively work to foster an environment which encourages participation across experience levels, coding language fluency, *technology choices*\*, and scientific disciplines.

<p><b>Sciware</b> is a Flatiron-wide activity to share
and build scientific software development and computing skills in a variety of
areas. Our goal is to create an environment where everyone can discuss
technologies, tools, and tricks that make their research process more
efficient, across all experience levels, language and technology choices, and
scientific disciplines.  We meet roughly once a month on Thursdays at 3pm and
focus on a specific topic, bringing Flatiron (and occasionally external)
expertise together to demonstrate and discuss everything from debuggers to
editors to file formats, optimization to packaging.  Events are open to all
Flatiron and Simons Foundation researchers, as well as their external students
and collaborators.</p>

Many of the recordings from past events are available on our Vimeo Sciware
channel [https://vimeo.com/showcase/sciware, password: "flatiron"] and the
materials are available in the Sciware Github repository
[https://github.com/flatironinstitute/sciware].  There is also a
#sciware channel on the Simons Foundation Slack that everyone is encouraged to
join and ask questions, share knowledge, or request code reviews.

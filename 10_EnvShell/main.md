## Shells and Environments

https://github.com/flatironinstitute/learn-sciware-dev/tree/master/10_EnvShell


## Rules of Engagement

### Goal:

Activities where participants all actively work to foster an environment which encourages participation across experience levels, coding language fluency, _technology choices_\*, and scientific disciplines.

<small>\*though sometimes we try to expand your options</small>


## Rules of Engagement

- Avoid discussions between a few people on a narrow topic
- Provide time for people who haven't spoken to speak/ask questions
- Provide time for experts to share wisdom and discuss
- Work together to make discussions accessible to novices

<small>
(These will always be a work in progress and will be updated, clarified, or expanded as needed.)
</small>


## Zoom Specific

- If comfortable, please keep video on so we can all see each other's faces.
- Ok to break in for quick, clarifying questions.
- Use Raise Hand feature for new topics or for more in-depth questions.
- Please stay muted if not speaking. (Host may mute you.)
- We are recording, posted on #sciware Slack


## Feedback

- Future sessions planned:
  - github with Software Carpentry Sep 25-26 (2 day session!)
  - Designing APIs and software library interfaces
  - Data storage file formats (hdf5, numpy, parquet, sqlite, ...)
- Suggest topics and vote on options in #sciware Slack


## Today's Agenda

- Environment variables
  - Introduction
  - Specific variables
  - Control
- Shells
  - Comparison
  - Features



## Basic terms

One often hears the following used interchangeably. Let's clarify.

    - Kernel
    - Shell
    - Command Line
    - Console


### Kernel & Operating System

- Kernel: the bridge between application software and hardware.
- Operating System: comprised of a kernel + other applications.
- Linux can refer to a kernel or an OS built on that kernel.


### Shell

- Name origin: Shell interface üêö surrounds the kernel just as a nutshell surrounds a nut ü•ú.
- Shell is a program that takes commands, gives them to the operating system to perform, and returns output.
- In the old days, it was the _only_ user interface. Nowadays, we have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in addition to command line interfaces (CLIs) such as the shell.


### Shell Examples

- On most Linux systems `bash` (which stands for Bourne Again SHell, an enhanced version of the original Unix shell program, `sh`, written by Steve Bourne) acts as the shell program.
- Besides bash, other shell programs include: `fish`, `ksh`, `tcsh`, and `zsh`.
- Note: As of macOS Catalina (Nov 19), `zsh` is now the default Mac shell.


### Terminal

- Terminal is a program that runs and provides I/O to a shell (or other program).
- Originally a physical device, now we run software terminal emulators.
- Many different terminal emulators (Gnome-Terminal, iTerm, Terminator, xterm), but they all do the same thing - give you access to a shell session.
- Opinions?


### Console

- Console originally referred to the physical text entry and display device for system administration messages.
- Now often used specifically in context of sys admin messages from BIOS, kernel, and the system logger, or the text mode of the OS (Alt-F1 in Linux).
- ```javascript
  console.log("üëãfrom your web browser.");
  ```


### Bash Startup Process

The bash shell program uses a collection of startup files to help create an environment. Each file has a specific use and may affect login and interactive environments differently. The files in the /etc directory generally provide global settings. If an equivalent file exists in your home directory it may override the global settings.

## Environment variables

<small>Jump to Nick's slides</small>



### Environment control (Robert)


#### Shell variables

- Similar to local variables - set for current shell, don't persist in child processes
- Conventionally lower case ($history, $path, $aliases, etc.)
- Can list via a bare `set` command (depending on shell/mode, will print environment variables as well)
- Can delete with `unset var` command
```
$ fi="the best"
$ echo "flatiron is... $fi"
flatiron is... the best
$ sh
sh-4.2$ echo "flatiron is... $fi"
flatiron is...
```


#### Environment variables

- Persist through to child processes
- Conventionally upper case ($PATH, $HOME, etc.)
- Can list via a bare `export` or `/usr/bin/env` command
- Set with `export` command
- Can delete with `unset` command
- Set only for a child process by prepending
```
$ MY_ENV_VAR="Environment fun!" echo "Woo! $MY_ENV_VAR"
Woo! Environment fun!
$ echo "Woo! $MY_ENV_VAR"
Woo!
$ export FI="the GOAT"
$ echo "flatiron is... $FI"
flatiron is... the GOAT
$ sh
sh-4.2$ echo "flatiron is... $FI"
flatiron is... the GOAT
```


#### Variable expansion

- `foo=bar`, `file=mydata.csv`
- Concatenate: `${foo}stool` -> `barstool`
- Remove prefix: `${file##*.}` -> `csv`
- Remove suffix: `${file%%.*}` -> `mydata`
- Substitute prefix: `${file/#*./data.}` -> `data.csv`
- Substitute suffix: `${file/%.*/.bin}` -> `mydata.bin`
- Brace expansion: `{1..10..2}` -> `1 3 5 7 9`


#### Executing shell scripts: `source`, `.`, and `chmod +x`

- `source myscript.sh` and `. myscript.sh` will _generally_ execute the script in the current shell
-- all variables set in the file will persist in your shell after execution is complete
-- `source` and `.` are handled differently in different shells, depending on the mode, but are largely identical for most purposes
- Making a script executable via `chmod` and executing via `./myscript.sh` will execute the script in a child process, and the variables will **not** persist into your current shell


#### Startup files

- `zsh`: `/etc/zprofile`, `.zprofile`, `.zshrc`
- `bash`: `/etc/profile`, `.profile`, `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, 
- 'profile' files executed only on __login__ shells (e.g. `ssh`, `bash --login`), and should typically contain only environment variable definitions. It's common to source the relevant 'rc' file here.
- 'rc' files executed only on __interactive__ shells. Used for everything else (aliases, functions, bash/zsh variables, etc). 
- Avoid issues with `scp`: in 'rc' file `[ -z "$PS1" ] && return`


### Environment Management


#### Modules


#### Conda/venv


#### Manual sourcing



## Shells

### Comparison (Dylan)


#### History

<img src="img/evolve.svg" width="1000" style="border:0;box-shadow:none">

- run commands, interactive
- slowly developed more scripting features
- control structure syntax: ALGOL (`fi`, `esac`), C (`{}`)


#### Evolution

- ksh introduced functions
- tcsh invented history, alias, other interactive features
- bash developed (and spun off) readline, key bindings
     - <small>emacs mode, vi mode, custom bindings in `.inputrc`</small>
- zsh added sophisticated tab-completion, prompts
     - <small>`git diff <tab>`, `rsync host:<tab>`, `gcc -<tab>`</small>
- POSIX.2 standardized minimal shell features (see `dash`)

most modern shells copied, adopted similar, popular features

#### Preferences

- bash
  - most common shell, especially for scripting
  - often assumed default
  - lags behind, catches up
- tcsh: fallen out of favor, non-POSIX, still maintained
- zsh
  - large, superset of **compatible with bash** and tcsh
  - many interactive and scripting features
  - more permissive license _(Apple)_
  - oh my zsh (plugins, themes)
- opinions?


#### Changing your shell

- Current shell: `$SHELL`, `ps`
- Most systems: `chsh`
- FI: email scicomp@flatironinstitute.org
- caveat: some things only work out of the box in bash (modules, source)
- alternative: exec different shell from `.bash_profile`

```sh
if [[ $- == *i* && -x /bin/zsh ]] ; then
	SHELL=/bin/zsh exec /bin/zsh -l
fi
```



### Configuring your prompt üé®



### Shell Features (Jonathan)

- Builtins
- Quoting and Word Splitting
- I/O Redirection
- Command and Process Substitution
- Globs
- Common programs that aren't builtins 


#### Builtins

- Q: What is a builtin?
- A: A builtin is a command you run that is part of the shell itself and not a separate executable
- Q: Why does this matter?
- A: These commands are accessible no matter what and are not dependent on other processes or variables (e.g., `PATH`)


##### More About Builtins

- There are over 70 builtin commands in bash (even more in zsh)
- Find them all by using the `help` command at your prompt (for zsh `man zshbuiltins`)
- Now, we will focus on a handful that are important to your interactive session


##### Today's Builtins

- `alias` and `command`
- `bg`, `fg`, `jobs`, `kill`, and *^C*
- `suspend` and *^Z*
- `cd`, `pwd`, `pushd`, `popd`, and `dirs`
- `export`
- `help`
- `history` and `fc`
- `source` and `.`


- `alias`: create or display a shortcut
   - with no arguments `alias` displays a list of all aliases
   - with a single word argument alias displays the definition of the alias to which the argument refers
   - with the argument `NAME=VALUE`, creates or updates the alias named *NAME* with the value of *VALUE*
- `command`: use the actual command or builtin, even if there is an alias making it something else
   - useful when you have an alias configued to run a command with a common set of flags
   - prefixing with `\` has a similar effect


- `bg`
   - puts the most recently suspended process in the background
- `fg`
   - brings the first process in the jobs list into the foreground
- `jobs`
   - displays the status of jobs and their ID
   - `-p` flag also gives the PID for the relevant process
   - common statuses are running, suspended, killed


- `kill`: terminates the process specified by either a PID or a job number
   - `-HUP`: "Good afternoon process, please consider stopping or maybe re-reading your configuration file"
   - `-TERM` (default): "hey process, just die."
   - `-KILL`: "DIE DIE DIE STUPID PROCESS!!!"
   - *^C* is equivalent to `-INT`: "please stop"


- *^Z*
   - suspend the process currently running in the foreground of your shell (`kill -TSTP`)
- `suspend`
   - suspend the execution of your shell (because *^Z* doesn't work for shells)


- `cd`
   - change into another directory
   - `cd -` puts you into the last directory you were in
   - `cd` with no arguments puts you back to your home directory
   - `cd A B` substitutes *A* for *B* in your path (zsh only)
- `pwd`
   - prints the name of the current working directory (also `$PWD`)


- `pushd`
   - change into a directory and place it onto the top of a stack
- `popd`
   - removes a directory from the top of the stack and changes into the new top of the stack
- `dirs`
   - shows the contents of the stack generated by `pushd`


- `export`
   - makes a variable able to be inherited by subsequent commands (creates an environment variable)


- `help`
   - with no arguments lists all shell builtins with very basic descriptions
   - with a single argument of a shell builtin, displays usage instructions on using the builtin


- `history`
   - display or manipulate the history of commands you have run
   - usually you just run it without arguments to remember something you did before
- `fc`
   - opens the last command in the editor, re-runs edited result
   - can also search history and do many other things (zsh)


- `source` and `.`
   - effectively the same thing
   - read and execute commands from a file (as if you typed them)
   - uses your `PATH` to find the file you specify (sometimes! zsh `source` looks in current directory first)
   - `.` is POSIX compliant, while `source` is the more readable version provided by bash


#### Quoting and Word Splitting

- spaces matter: for most things they define the boundaries of strings
- `"` vs `'`
  - `"` does variable expansion
  - `'` does not
- automatic string concatenation (nested quotes and such)
  - if you have consecutive quoted things
- `\`
  - escapes things like spaces or special characters


#### I/O Redirection

- `>` and `>>`
   - `>` writes output from a process to the file named after the greater than symbol. if the file already exists, it is overwritten.
   - `>>` appends output from a process to the file name after the double greater than. if the file does not exist, it is created.
   - `set -o noclobber` keeps you from overwriting files with `>`


##### stdin, stdout, stderr

- stdin (`0`) is a stream of information you send to a process
- stdout (`1`) is usually the expected output of a process
- stderr (`2`) is either related to something going wrong or sort of control/status information depending on the process
- what does this mean?  `2>&1`
   - this redirects standard error to standard output 


- `|`
   - take the stdout from one process and send it to the stdin of another. very useful 
- `<( CMD )` (and `>( CMD )`)
   - output from *CMD* is passed as if in a real file
   - multiple processes can write to the hidden file
   - the program that wants to read the data only needs to be able to open a file


#### Command and Process Substitution

- <code>\`CMD\`</code> or `$( CMD )`
   - this is replaced with the output of the command


#### Globs

Globs match things (but are less awesome than regular expressions)
- `*`: 0 or more any characters
- `?`: precisely any one character
- `[somelistofcharspickone]` precisely one character from the list in the brackets (case matters)
- if a glob doesn't match anything, then the glob stays as is (this can be confusing)
- (zsh) if you press tab to complete, it will expand the glob in-place


#### Not Builtins But Still Great

- `ls`
   - lists the files in a directory. if no directory is specified, lists the current directory
   - usually aliased with some options to make for easier color/formatting (and slower!)


- `man`
   - instructions on how to use a command
   - `man -k` / `apropos` is a keyword search of man pages (this is life changing)
   - if you try to use `man` on a builtin, you might get a generic or bash man page.


- `sed`, `awk`
   - `sed` is used to selectively edit streams of text (usually replacement or transformation of one or more characters)
   - `awk` is used to carve up text based around some field separators
   - `cut` selects single columns
   - effective for formatting output from a command to be piped to another command


- `nano`
   - basic editor. open. (^R) save. (^O) quit. (^X) 


- `rename`
   - rename multiple files based on a supplied expression
   - usually 3 arguments: starting format, ending format, and the things you want to change
      - `rename foo foo00 foo?`
      - the takes the files foo1 -> foo5 and makes them foo001 -> foo005


- `sleep`
   - wait for some number of seconds (or other unit) based on a single argument


- `less` (is `more`)
   - paginates output, so we can read it before it scrolls past 
- `cat`
   - does not

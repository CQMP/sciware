# Defining our Terms

One often hears the terms terminal, command line, shell, and console used interchangably so before we discuss the configuration, let us define our terms.

### Kernel

Kernel is the bridge between application software and hardware. When a computer boots up, a kernel recognizes its own physical hardware and enables each component to talk with one another. It is the first program that is loaded into the main memory and remains in the main memory until the system is shut down.

The Operating System is comprised of a kernel and a bunch of other applications that control the very low-level aspects of the hardware and provides APIs to software to use them.

Note that Linux is not an OS, but rather a kernel.

Ex: Hardware drivers, orchestrated by the kernel, keep fans active to prevent overheating, disk space is monitored, RAM states managed, new devices are detected, and so on.

### Shell

Simply put, the shell is a program that takes commands, gives them to the operating system to perform, and returns output. In the old days, it was the only user interface available on a Unix-like system such as Linux. Nowadays, we have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in addition to command line interfaces (CLIs) such as the shell.

There are different accounts on why the term "shell" was chosen, but a believable explanation is that the shell interface üêö surrounds the kernel just as a nutshell surrounds a nut ü•ú.

On most Linux systems a program called bash (which stands for Bourne Again SHell, an enhanced version of the original Unix shell program, sh, written by Steve Bourne) acts as the shell program. Besides bash, there are other shell programs that can be installed in a Linux system. These include: ksh, tcsh and zsh.Note: As of macOS Catalina (Nov 19), `zsh` is now the default Mac shell. Dylan will be doing a shell comparison later.

### Terminal

Terminal is a program that runs a shell. In the past it was a physical device (Before terminals were monitors with keyboards, they were teletypes) and then this concept was transferred into software.

While there are a number of different terminal emulators (Gnome-Terminal, iTerm), they all do the same thing - give you access to a shell session. You will probably develop a preference for one.

### Process

A process is the instance of a computer program that is being executed by one or many threads.

While a computer program is a passive collection of instructions, a process is the actual execution of those instructions. Several processes may be associated with the same program; for example, opening up several instances of the same program often results in more than one process being executed.

## Startup Process

The bash shell program bash uses a collection of startup files to help create an environment. Each file has a specific use and may affect login and interactive environments differently. The files in the /etc directory generally provide global settings. If an equivalent file exists in your home directory it may override the global settings.

### Invoked as an interactive login shell, or with --login

When Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists. After reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable. The --noprofile option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.

When an interactive login shell exits, or a non-interactive login shell executes the exit builtin command, Bash reads and executes commands from the file ~/.bash_logout, if it exists.

### Invoked as an interactive non-login shell

When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, Bash reads and executes commands from ~/.bashrc, if that file exists. This may be inhibited by using the --norc option. The --rcfile file option will force Bash to read and execute commands from file instead of ~/.bashrc.

So, typically, your ~/.bash_profile contains the line

if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then . ~/.bashrc; fi
after (or before) any login-specific initializations.

Invoked non-interactively
When Bash is started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for example, it looks for the variable BASH_ENV in the environment, expands its value if it appears there, and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute. Bash behaves as if the following command were executed:

if [ -n "$BASH_ENV" ]; then . "\$BASH_ENV"; fi
but the value of the PATH variable is not used to search for the filename.

As noted above, if a non-interactive shell is invoked with the --login option, Bash attempts to read and execute commands from the login shell startup files.

# Intro to Testing Scientific Software



## What is a "test"?

* Something you can run (a program, script, function)
* Distinct from your "real" code (unnecessary)
* That runs relatively quickly (while you wait)
* That executes some portion of your "real" code
* That checks something (?)
* And returns success if things are good, or some kind of error otherwise

# Sciware Overview

Activities facilitating scientific software development skills at the Flatiron Institute



# Vision

1) A positive and inclusive learning environment for all experience levels.


2) A blend of lecture, activities, and discussion to facilitate equal involvement across experience levels.


3) Topics general enough to be relevant to anyone doing scientific research.
   - For example, technology and coding language agnostic


4) Increase awareness and adoption of software development best practices to improve scientific productivity and quality.


5) To use the Flatiron Institute as a sandbox for development of something useful for all of science.


# Goal for today 

Motivate and provide an overview of the topics we plan to discuss 



# Meetings

1x/month for 2 hours
Spring: 4th Thursdays at 3pm
(Apr 25, May 23)


## Rules of Engagement

Goal: 
Foster an environment which encourages participation across experience levels, coding language fluency, technology choices, and scientific disciplines?


- Avoid discussions between two people on narrow topic
- Provide time for people who haven't spoken to speak/ask questions
- Find ways to be sure everybody is following and that folks aren't lost
- Make it engaging enough for experts to attend
- Make it accessible enough for novices to attend


## Format

Blend of presentations and intro followed by hands-on activities



# Today's Speakers


## Katharine Hyatt: Testing and why open source


## Joakim Anden: Version control and readable code


## Miles Stoudenmire: Performant/efficient code



## Software Engineering

### What is it (and why should you care)?

- Not how to write code (software development), but
- How to turn code into a product (process)
- "sound engineering principles to economically obtain software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines" (Fritz Bauer, 1972)
- "systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software" (IEEE)


### Software development at scale

- groups of developers and non-developers working together
- requirements, agile, scrum
- waterfall, release schedules
- QA, support, product management
- coordination between individuals with different skill sets and levels


### <strike>Software development at scale</strike>
### Efficient, sustainable development



### Efficient, sustainable development

### Produce working code more quickly

- Tools to write code faster
- Tools to find bugs sooner
- Shorten the iteration/feedback cycle


### Communicating with and protecting (against) your future self

- Invest in file structure, function naming
- Comment for yourself (your own thoughts as a reminder)
- Write tests to prevent later changes from breaking older parts ("regression" tests)


### Do more science, faster

- Productive languages and tools mean less time coding
- Reusable components mean less code to maintain
- A few minutes of optimization can save days of run time

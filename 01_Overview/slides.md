# Sciware Overview

Activities facilitating scientific software development skills at the Flatiron Institute


# Goals for Today 

- Describe vision for Sciware activity
- Motivate and provide an overview of the topics we plan to discuss 
- Hear multiple perspectives



# Vision

1. A positive and inclusive learning environment for all experience levels.
2. A blend of lecture, activities, and discussion to facilitate equal involvement across experience levels.
3. Topics general enough to be relevant to anyone doing scientific research.
    - For example, technology and coding language agnostic


# Vision

<ol start='4'>
<li>Increase awareness and adoption of software development best practices to improve scientific productivity and quality.</li>
<li>To use the Flatiron Institute as a sandbox for development of something useful for all of science.</li>
</li>


## Meetings and Format

- Blend of presentations and intro followed by hands-on activities
- 1x/month for 2 hours
- Location TBD

### Next dates: Apr 25, May 23

### Sciware channel on Simons Slack



## Rules of Engagement

### Goal: 

Participants all working to actively foster an environment which encourages participation across experience levels, coding language fluency, technology choices, and scientific disciplines.


## Rules of Engagement

- Avoid discussions between a few people on a narrow topic
- Provide time for people who haven't spoken to speak/ask questions
- Find ways to be sure everybody is following and that folks aren't lost
- Make it engaging enough for experts to attend
- Make it accessible enough for novices to attend

(These will always be a work in progress and will be updated, clarified, or expanded as needed.)



## Software Engineering (SCC)

### What is it (and why should you care)?

- Not how to write code (software development), but
- How to turn code into a product (process)
- "...*sound engineering principles to <b>economically</b> obtain software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines*" (Fritz Bauer, 1972)
- "...*systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software*" (IEEE)


### Software development at scale

- groups of developers and non-developers working together
- requirements, agile, scrum
- waterfall, release schedules
- QA, support, product management
- coordination between individuals with different skill sets and levels


### <strike>Software development at scale</strike>
### *Economic*, sustainable development


## Efficient, sustainable development

### Produce working code more quickly

- Tools to write code faster
- Tools to find bugs sooner
- Shorten the iteration/feedback cycle


### Communicating with and protecting (against) your future self

- Invest in file structure, function naming
- Comment for yourself (your own thoughts as a reminder)
- Write tests to prevent later changes from breaking older parts ("regression" tests)


### Do more science, faster

- Productive languages and tools mean less time coding
- Reusable components mean less code to maintain
- A few minutes of optimization can save days of run time



## Katharine Hyatt (CCQ)
### Testing and why open source


## Open Source Mindset
  - People from other fields can ask deceptively simple questions
  - Passive way to solicit feedback and code improvements, verify correctness
  - Advertise your work and techniques to more people
  - Open source is democratizing
  - Openness is a fundamental value of science
  - Don’t have to reinvent the wheel


## FLOSS in Action
  - “I have no idea why, but suddenly radio astronomers are interested in fixing bugs in my package?”
  - “I just wanted to learn how debuggers work, and then I ended up writing big parts of the Julia compiler and garbage collector…”
  - Physics, math, and CS people spontaneously collaborating to create a huge ecosystem of ODE/PDE solving tools


## Testing
  - Force ourselves to ask: what does this code actually do?
  - Often writing tests spurs rewrites which make code clearer and more robust
  - Easier to catch problems early and know immediately if a change broke something
  - Good way to onboard new contributors



## Joakim Anden (CCM)
### Version control and readable code



## Olivier Parcollet (as Miles Stoudenmire) (CCQ)
### Performant/efficient code



## What's next? 
What topics we want to cover in next two meetings?

### Apr 25

### May 23

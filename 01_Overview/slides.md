# Sciware Overview

Activities facilitating scientific software development skills at the Flatiron Institute



# Vision

1) A positive and inclusive learning environment for all experience levels.


2) A blend of lecture, activities, and discussion to facilitate equal involvement across experience levels.


3) Topics general enough to be relevant to anyone doing scientific research.
   - For example, technology and coding language agnostic


4) Increase awareness and adoption of software development best practices to improve scientific productivity and quality.


5) To use the Flatiron Institute as a sandbox for development of something useful for all of science.


# Goal for today

## Rules of Engagement

Goal: 
Foster an environment which encourages participation across experience levels, coding language fluency, technology choices, and scientific disciplines?


- Avoid discussions between two people on narrow topic
- Provide time for people who haven't spoken to speak/ask questions
- Find ways to be sure everybody is following and that folks aren't lost
- Make it engaging enough for experts to attend
- Make it accessible enough for novices to attend


## Format

Blend of presentations and intro followed by hands-on activities

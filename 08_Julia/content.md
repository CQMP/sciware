# Sciware

## Intro to Julia

https://github.com/flatironinstitute/learn-sciware-dev/tree/master/08_Julia


## Rules of Engagement

### Goal: 

Activities where participants all actively work to foster an environment which encourages participation across experience levels, coding language fluency, *technology choices*\*, and scientific disciplines.

<small>\*though sometimes we try to expand your options</small>


## Rules of Engagement

- Avoid discussions between a few people on a narrow topic
- Provide time for people who haven't spoken to speak/ask questions
- Provide time for experts to share wisdom and discuss 
- Work together to make discussions accessible to novices

<small>
(These will always be a work in progress and will be updated, clarified, or expanded as needed.)

## Zoom Specific 

- We are recording for internal and personal use. 
- If comfortable, please keep video on so we can all see each other's faces.
- Ok to break in for quick, clarifying questions.
- Use Raise Hand feature for new topics or for more in-depth questions.
- Please stay muted if not speaking. (Host may mute you.)


## Next Sciware

- Intel VTune?  May 28/June 4? (poll on slack)


## Sciwares in the Pipeline

- Intro to Github, in collaboration with Software Carpentry.

# Sciware

## Getting Started with Parallel and Distributed Computing

https://github.com/flatironinstitute/learn-sciware-dev/tree/master/05_Parallelization


## Rules of Engagement

### Goal: 

Activities where participants all actively work to foster an environment which encourages participation across experience levels, coding language fluency, technology choices, and scientific disciplines.


## Rules of Engagement

- Avoid discussions between a few people on a narrow topic
- Provide time for people who haven't spoken to speak/ask questions
- Provide time for experts to share wisdom and discuss 
- Work together to make discussions accessible to novices

(These will always be a work in progress and will be updated, clarified, or expanded as needed.)


## Schedule

- Intro to Latent Parallelism (Nick, SCC)
- Terminology (Dylan, SCC)
- Rank Based Parallelism Demo (Nick, SCC)
- Abstractions, Libraries, and Worker Pools (Dylan, SCC)
- Discussion


## Let's start an experiment together!

Please run on your laptop or on a cluster. We want it running on different types of machines.

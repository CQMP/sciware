# MATLAB real-world optics code example

This is actually a rather typical research code exchange situation.

Discuss the utility of the following function, that Alex needed to compare
against in optics (don't go into the weeds here...) :

[bdfw.m.orig](https://github.com/ahbarnett/fresnaq/blob/master/bdrymeths/bdwf.m.orig)

What would be needed to make it usable?

Here is a more usable version:

[bdwf.m](https://github.com/ahbarnett/fresnaq/blob/master/bdrymeths/bdwf.m)

plus

[test_bdwf.m](https://github.com/ahbarnett/fresnaq/blob/master/bdrymeths/test_bdwf.m)

Finally, what changes from that interface were done here: ?

[bdfw_pts.m](https://github.com/ahbarnett/fresnaq/blob/master/bdrymeths/bdwf_pts.m)

Discuss advantages/disadvantages of this new interface, in terms of ease of use. (A full discussion requires some parsing of the code.)

## Functions

https://github.com/flatironinstitute/learn-sciware-dev/tree/master/12_Functions


## Rules of Engagement

### Goal:

Activities where participants all actively work to foster an environment which encourages participation across experience levels, coding language fluency, *technology choices*\*, and scientific disciplines.

<small>\*though sometimes we try to expand your options</small>


## Rules of Engagement

- Avoid discussions between a few people on a narrow topic
- Provide time for people who haven't spoken to speak/ask questions
- Provide time for experts to share wisdom and discuss
- Work together to make discussions accessible to novices

<small>
(These will always be a work in progress and will be updated, clarified, or expanded as needed.)
</small>


## Zoom Specific

- If comfortable, please keep video on so we can all see each other's faces.
- Ok to break in for quick, clarifying questions.
- Use Raise Hand feature for new topics or for more in-depth questions.
- Please stay muted if not speaking. (Host may mute you.)
- We are recording. Link will be posted on #sciware Slack.


## Future Sessions

- Sciware "Office Hours" follow-up discussion in 2 weeks (Nov 19)
- Future sessions planned:
  - Intro to R
  - Data storage file formats (hdf5, numpy, parquet, sqlite, ...)
- Suggest topics and vote on options in #sciware Slack


## Today's Agenda

- Intro: what is a function? (Alex)
- Designing good functions (Bob)
- Packaging a Jabberwocky (Alex)
- Group exercises!
- Case studies and discussion (Joakim)

## Intro: what is a function? (Alex)


### What is a function?

<section>
Say you have python script/notebook including the snippet...

```python
S = 0; T = 0
for i in range(10) :
  S += a[i]*a[i]
for i in range(20) :
  T += b[i]*b[i]
result = S-T
```
<small>Seems to sum the squares of array a, then similar for b, then subtract them.</small>

<p class="fragment">

Good to package the self-contained repeated task as a *function*:
```python
def sumsquares(a):
    """Sum the squares of the elements of a NumPy array."""
    return sum(a*a)
```

</p>
<p class="fragment">

Then entire snippet becomes much simpler, *and* easier to read:
```python
result = sumsquares(a)-sumsquares(b)
```
plus other users, and future you, get a useful tool: a function :)

</p>
</section>


### Functions are sad without tests

```python
def sumsquares(a):
    """Sum the squares of the elements of a NumPy array."""
    return sum(a*a)
```
A ("pure") function has inputs (array ``a``), outputs (return value)
- refers to no global variables
- has no "state" (internal memory). This makes it *testable*.


Never trust a func you wrote but didn't test! A simple tester:
```python
import numpy as np
if sumsquares(np.array((3.0,4.0))) == 25.0:
    print('pass')
else:
    print('fail')
```
Q: why else are test "driver" codes useful?

*shows a human how to use your function*

<!-- are more elaborate tests, like what if you send it empy, or non-numpy array... -->


### Standing on the shoulders of giants

We rely on other people's functions all the time, eg ``y=sin(x)`` (low-level math lib), ``coeffs=numpy.polyfit(y,x,degree)``.
Good *design* work went into these functions, as docs show:

<img src="pics/polyfit_doc.png" align="center">


Note _interface_: simple required args; advanced ones are optional

You can be a giant too, by writing (& distributing) your own functions!


### Session goals & topics

__I. Get us to package most of our code as functions:__
- breaks tasks in to *separately* testable components
- clean, modular code, leaving scripts/notebooks short and readable

__II. Write functions with good interfaces, and critique them:__
- naming, inputs, outputs, their types, optional args
- testers, documentation
- these are *just as important* as the algorithm ("meat") inside the function
Otherwise no-one will use your functions... and that includes future you!  :(


Call it: <font color="red">"good interface design"</font>, in sense of API (application programmer interface). Can include *wrapping existing code so it can be called from another language* (eg Python ``y=sin(x)`` actually wraps ``libm`` library)

[Not to be confused with: "interfacing" in sense of UX/UI (user experience), human-computer interfaces, package management (``apt`` etc)...]

Any questions about what we're talking about or goals ?

## Packaging a Jabberwocky (Alex)

(why Jabberwocky? Because all technical terms in science codes are *nonsense poems* to other users outside that area)


### Creating a good function from a script

You heard your friend wrote code once that included a cool way to find a place \\(x\\) where some 1D function \\(f(x)=0\\). You ask and they say, sure, here you go:!
```python
# script proving my gimble is frumious! (recall technical words are gibberish to other users)
for brillig in np.arange(0, pi, 0.1):
    mimsy = cos(brillig)
    wabe_guess = 1.5
    while True:
        wabe_newguess = wabe_guess - runcible(mimsy, wabe_guess) / runciblederivative(mimsy, wabe_guess)
        if abs(wabe_newguess - wabe_guess) < 1e-9:
            break
        wabe_guess = wabe_newguess        
    print(bandersnatch(brillig, wabe_newguess))
```
You laugh, but this is a common collaboration experience!


How useful is this to you? Must waste time understanding the whole script, some outer loop. Is runcible a 1D function? It has 2 args. Whereâ€™s the bit that finds the zero of a 1D function? What variable contains the answer??


### Split out a root-finding function

Ok, in real world at this point you'd read around, eventually (!) find ``scipy.optimize.newton``, and be done. Say internet is broken. Need to make own func.

Ah, you realize it's doing Newton's iteration \\[x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}\\] so that the sequence \\(x_0, x_1, \ldots\\) tends to a root.
`mimsy` is some parameter we ignore. `wabe` is \\(x\\), which is a simpler and more universal variable name!

Let's wrap in interface for roots of a *general* function, not just `runcible`!

We steal the same *algorithm* as the script, just do better *packaging*.


### First draft function

```python
def rootfind1d(f, dfdx, x0):
    """Find a nearby root of a 1D scalar function.
    Inputs: f - a 1D scalar function
            dfdx - its derivative function
            x0 - an initial guess to the root
    Returned value: approximate root x, meaning f(x)=0.
    Notes: uses the Newton-Raphson iteration.
    """
    while True:
        xnew = x0 - f(x0)/dfdx(x0)
        if abs(xnew-x0) < 1e-9:
            break
        x0 = xnew
    return xnew
```
Look it has docs! I suggest you even write the docs *before* you write the
body of the function.

Q: are we done with this basic draft?


No, recall it is *incomplete* without a test routine, like this:
```python
    from math import *
    f = lambda x: sin(x)
    dfdx = lambda x: cos(x)
    x = rootfind1d(f, dfdx, 2.0)
    if abs(x-pi)<1e-9:
        print('pass')
    else:
        print('fail')
```
Very niiice! Universal simple *math* language (all jargon gone).

Now why didn't your friend hand you this in the first place?? If they had been a good structured coder, they would have :)

And So Can You\*.

### Improvements

The tolerance check `1e-9` was particular to frumious gimbles. Think about your user (or future self): they'll want to change it. Now they can:

```python
def rootfind1d(f, dfdx, x0, tol=1e-9):
    """Find a nearby root of a 1D scalar function.
    Inputs: f - a 1D scalar function
            dfdx - its derivative function
            x0 - an initial guess to the root
            tol (optional) - desired absolute tolerance in the root
    Returned value: approximate root x, meaning f(x)=0.
    Notes: uses the Newton-Raphson iteration.
    """
    while True:
        xnew = x0 - f(x0)/dfdx(x0)
        if abs(xnew-x0) < tol:
            break
        x0 = xnew
    return xnew
```


Optional args are a great way make it easy on the basic user while the power user can tweak various algorithm parameters from *sensible defaults*.

Q: how *else* could you improve this function or its tests?

A: group exercise / discussion !



<!-- EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE -->
## Exercises (breakouts)

Choose an example to work on in a small group, from the files in the [repo](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/learn-sciware-dev/tree/master/12_Functions/exercise)

There are different languages.



## Discussion, guides (Joakim)


### Naming

Comments are good, but names are better.

```python
def get_values2(x, y):
    temp = np.mean(np.abs(x - y) ** 2)

    return temp
```

vs.

```python
def mean_squared_error(x, x_ref):
    mse = np.mean(np.abs(x - x_ref) ** 2)

    return mse
```

Comments can go stale and require maintenance.

Comments also can't be tested (generally).


### High- and low-level APIs

More advanced libraries or packages can have multiple levels of APIs.

High level calls low level.

```c
fftw_plan fftw_plan_dft_1d(int n, fftw_complex *in, fftw_complex *out,
                           int sign, unsigned flags);
```

```c
fftw_plan fftw_plan_guru_dft(
     int rank, const fftw_iodim *dims,
     int howmany_rank, const fftw_iodim *howmany_dims,
     fftw_complex *in, fftw_complex *out,
     int sign, unsigned flags);
```

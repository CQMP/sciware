# Documentation
### How to win users and influence science

https://github.com/flatironinstitute/sciware/tree/main/20_Documentation


## Rules of Engagement

### Goal:

Activities where participants all actively work to foster an environment which encourages participation across experience levels, coding language fluency, *technology choices*\*, and scientific disciplines.

<small>\*though sometimes we try to expand your options</small>


## Rules of Engagement

- Avoid discussions between a few people on a narrow topic
- Provide time for people who haven't spoken to speak/ask questions
- Provide time for experts to share wisdom and discuss
- Work together to make discussions accessible to novices

<small>
(These will always be a work in progress and will be updated, clarified, or expanded as needed.)
</small>


## Zoom Specific

- If comfortable, please keep video on so we can all see each other's faces.
- OK to break in for quick, clarifying questions.
- Use Raise Hand feature for new topics or for more in-depth questions.
- Please stay muted if not speaking. (Host may mute you.)
- We are recording. Link will be posted on #sciware Slack.
- Please keep questions for the speaker in the Zoom chat.


## Future Sessions

- Suggest topics and vote on options in #sciware Slack

# Tools to Generate Documentation


## Tools to Generate Documentation

- Let's break "documentation" into two categories
    - **Narrative** documentation: high-level, "instruction manual" prose
    - **API** documentation: granular technical specifications


## Tools for Narrative Documentation
- In order of increasing feature-richness and complexity
    - The `README`
    - Wiki
    - Jekyll + static web hosting (e.g. GitHub Pages)
    - Sphinx + ReadTheDocs


## Narrative Documentation: the `README`
- The simplest form of top-level documentation
- Highly portable, easily rendered into a webpage or read in a terminal
- Often where you will start documentationâ€”don't underestimate the usefulness!
    - Great idea to jot down the steps to run your code in a `README` as soon as you start
    - We all promise ourselves we'll set up beautiful documentation later, but in case that doesn't happen, a `README` is a lifesaver
- GitHub and other code hosting sites will render your `README`


## Formatting the `README`
- Two popular languages to make your plain-text `README` look nice online:
    - Markdown (`README.md`)
    - reStructuredText (`README.rst`)
- Either one will help you render text

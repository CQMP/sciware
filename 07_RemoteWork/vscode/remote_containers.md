# VSCode - Remote-Containers extension

*Note* - don't let the "Remote" in the name of the extension confuse you. This extension is primarily used locally for development.

This vscode extension allows you to:

* Create an isolated development environment
* Fully specify the operating system and dependencies needed to develop your project using a Dockerfile recipe
* Open your project in a vscode session that is running inside a docker container on your local machine
* Share your exact development environment with co-developers (even if they are on a different OS)

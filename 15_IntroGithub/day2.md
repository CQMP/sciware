# Sciware

## Intro to Github

## Rules of Engagement

### Goal:

Activities where participants all actively work to foster an environment which encourages participation across experience levels, coding language fluency, *technology choices*\*, and scientific disciplines.

<small>\*though sometimes we try to expand your options</small>


## Rules of Engagement

- Avoid discussions between a few people on a narrow topic
- Provide time for people who haven't spoken to speak/ask questions
- Provide time for experts to share wisdom and discuss
- Work together to make discussions accessible to novices

<small>
(These will always be a work in progress and will be updated, clarified, or expanded as needed.)
</small>


## Zoom Specific

- If comfortable, please keep video on so we can all see each other's faces.
- Ok to break in for quick, clarifying questions.
- Use Raise Hand feature for new topics or for more in-depth questions.
- Please stay muted if not speaking. (Host may mute you.)
- We are recording. Link will be posted on #sciware Slack.


## Future Sessions

- July 8: Intro to IDEs and Debugging
- Suggest topics and vote on options in #sciware Slack

## Distributed Workflow

## Distributed Workflow

> Each contributor has not one, but two Git repositories: a personal fork local one and a public server-side one.


## Distributed Workflow

1. Fork and clone the project
2. Make a new branch for your feature
3. Add the code and push to your fork
4. Open a pull request


## EXTRA SLIDE

Another way to visualize this workflow:

## Step 1: Fork and Clone

<div>
    First we need to fork the repo

</div>

<div class="fragment">
    Next, we clone <em>our</em> fork of the repo:
    <pre>
        <code data-trim data-noescape>
        git clone https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/sciware_intro_git_2021_06_17.git
        </code>
    </pre>
</div>
